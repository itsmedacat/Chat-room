    <p>Idk what to put here. I guess im a beginner html/css/javscript coder, but I also code unity (C#) and python. I'm not very good at either though, so don't expect anything very good to be put into this website. By the way, how did you even find this? Like. This is supposed to be private. Whatever</p>
